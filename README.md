# Predicto
This is a prediction app build used to reduce the delivery time of any order placed to a restaurant. The app has two major applications. In the first application , the app uses time-series forecasting in order to predict the number of orders that can be receive on a particular day depending on various factors. This can be used by the restaurants to prep for the orders before hand. The other application is using clustering algorithms in order to predict the hot spots for orders which can be used by the delivery executives. Yet another application is to re-route the order to the nearest branch in case there is a serge in the number or orders in any area.
